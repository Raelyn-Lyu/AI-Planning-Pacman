# AI-Planning-Pacman

The Pac-Man projects were developed for UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence course, CS 188. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. However, these projects don't focus on building AI for video games. Instead, they teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

We designed the engine using three different planning methods: Minimax, Mont-Carlo Tree and simple heuristic exploration;
In the end of the final game we beated all test engines devised by teaching stuff and win 6/126 position among all teams by using Mont-Carlo simulations.
